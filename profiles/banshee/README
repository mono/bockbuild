Making a release:

  - remove your build-root directory; release builds should rebuild the whole
    world to ensure no regressions or build quirks were introduced during
    any testing

  - start the release build process:
  
      $ ./darwin.py -bvr

  - next start the bundling process:

      $ ./darwin.py -e > darwin.env
	  $ source darwin.env
	  $ pushd ../../solitary
	  $ make
	  $ popd
	  $ ./darwin.py -z

  - now test the bundle. You *must* do this in a new shell instance,
    because your current instance has the build environment sourced in,
	which will conflict with the .app bundle. So start a new shell, and
	find your way back to the banshee bockbuild profile directory:

	  $ bundle.darwin/Banshee.app/Contents/MacOS/Banshee --debug

  - at this point, Banshee should be up and running from the bundle. Here
    you need to just smoke test the build:

	  * Make sure the theme is loaded properly
	  * Make sure all the source view icons are loaded
	  * Test MP3 playback, etc.
	  * Try Last.fm
	  * etc, etc.
